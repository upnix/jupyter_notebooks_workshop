# Jupyter Notebooks: Your academic superpower
Introduces Jupyter as a "scholarly superpower." Designed for high school students who have graduated from grade 10 or 11.  

`Jupyter_Notebooks_Workshop.ipynb` is the main notebook. It's written so that it can be used by the student independently, although I used it as part of a 45 minute workshop.  

***Workshop notes:***
I gave this workshop six times, altering how I presented it each time to try to increase engagement. My notes are:
* *What didn't work:*
    * Giving an intro to each section, then allowing time to go through that section independently seemed to work. My workshop may as well have been a YouTube video.
    * Asking students "What's the first thing you'd do to try to solve this?" I got a lot of programming answers to something that wasn't supposed to be about programming.
* *What I think worked well:*
    * Telling them what I would do in a particular scenario.
    * Telling them ChatGPT could write their code for them.
    * After doing the above two I noticed I started getting more questions.
* *What I ended up doing:*
    * Skipping over the introduction to Jupyter and JupyterLab seemed ok and allowed for more time on more interesting aspects of Jupyter. I did point out to students that they could come back to this on their own for background.
    * I was clear that my goal was to convince them that Jupyter was a tool that could help them solve problems, explain ideas, and more. However, due to limited time I could only give them a few examples.
    * I emphasized the parts of Jupyter that I find especially helpful:
        * Iterating on the same cell, building up some code/solution.
        * Breaking a large problem down across multiple cells.
        * Documenting your thought process, making mistakes, revising.
    * I made sure to keep the SageMath part. Students seemed familiar with tools like Mathematica and Matlab, so I liked that I could present them with a free alternative. It also served to introduce Jupyter kernels.
